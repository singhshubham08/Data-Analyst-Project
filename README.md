# Unemployment During Covid-19 in India - Power BI Dashboard

# Project Overview
Welcome to this Unemployement during COVID-19 In India PowerBI-Dashboard.
I have created this project during my Data Analytics Internship.
In this project you can filter the data according to particular state and date.
During this project I have analyzed the unemployment rate in India during COVID- 19 and identify unemployment rate by states, year & month, area (rural or urban); and average employed people by states and areas.
This project showcases a Power BI Dashboard that analyzes unemployment trends in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The data has been sourced from CognoRise and processed using Microsoft Excel to prepare it for detailed analysis and visualization in Power BI.
