# Project Overview
Welcome to this Unemployement during COVID-19 In India PowerBI-Dashboard.
I have created this project during my Data Analytics Internship.
In this project you can filter the data according to particular state and date.
During this project I have analyzed the unemployment rate in India during COVID- 19 and identify unemployment rate by states, year & month, area (rural or urban); and average employed people by states and areas.
